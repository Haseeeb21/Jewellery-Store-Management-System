## Project Title: 	
<h1 align="center">Jewelry Store Management System</h1>



## Abstract:

There are number of jewelry stores in the world, and as the world is advancing day by day and so is the technology advancing. The technology is advancing vastly, there are number of web and desktop applications for such store. So, I have decided as our DBS project to make a desktop application for the jewelry store and make it simple, efficient, and easy to use for the user. This application can be used in different shops and stores with different changes in the forms of the application.

## Project Description:
My project is based on the basic forms of a jewelry store, the `UI` is made simple and easy to use which is user friendly. It consists of 10 forms, each specifying its purpose. First, Login is asked from the user if the credentials are true then he is given access and he is moved to the Home Page, and from there the user can edit, view, delete from different tables in the database.

My database name is `HASEEB`, which is on a particular laptop on which our desktop application is running (`local database`).
The database consists of five tables.
I have used `SQL Server` as backend to store the data and the forms were created on visual studio and the coding was done in `C#`. 

## Tables in our Database:

There are five tables in our database, which relate to our database.
1.	Login
2.	Employee
3.	Customer
4.	Products 
5.	Bill

## Output at each stage:

We are only given access when our username and password match the username and password in the database. If it matches then we are given access and moved to home page, else error occurs, and we must try again.

The home page will open after we are given access and our login has succeeded, from home page we can navigate to any of the options.

After pressing the reset button, the data in the entries field is cleared and the text boxes are made empty.
